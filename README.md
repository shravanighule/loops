Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements or loops.

Theory:Decision-making statements in C++ are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These statements evaluate conditions and execute specific code blocks depending on whether the conditions are true or false. The primary decision-making statements in C++ include if, else if, else, switch, and conditional (ternary) operators. The if statement allows for executing a block of code if a condition is true, and can be extended with else if and else for multiple conditions. The switch statement provides a way to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable, making it a suitable choice for situations with multiple possible discrete values. The conditional operator ?: offers a compact syntax for simple if-else conditions. These decision-making constructs enable developers to create dynamic and responsive programs that can adapt to varying inputs and scenarios, forming the backbone of logic control in software applications
